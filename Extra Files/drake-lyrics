And Pass Me, Classy, Something Like Drew Lord

[Chorus:]
(Yea Man; Yea)
You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do

[Verse 2: Drake]
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be
Since A Young Dude The Flow Was Nasty Acidic

But I Pay No Mind Though

I Take It You Know That
You Take It Sitting Down
Or You Can Take It To Gold Black
And Since Drake Done Took It From Curls To Waves
Its Been Kind Of Like A Whirlwind Phase
I Mean I Had My Share Of Women
Now A Nigga Gettin Girls For Days
With Most Of Em Its Seemin Like They World Is Staged
But From Georgia To Bk And All Around The World
Get Your Hands In The Air If Your Avoiding The Cliche
If You've Been Hurt And You Alone Be Steady
These The Same Dudes From Rewind, Grown And Ready, And Uh

[Chorus:]
(Yea; Uh)
You Can Just Love Me Like They Do
(Vo We Back Man; Its A Beautiful Thing Dog)

Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be
Look Theres Requirements To Be An Admirer
Still The New Version Of Fresh Needa A Nia Or Tyra
So We Can Be Jenny And Swayze
I Told You I'm Careful With My Heart Girl, Many Have Played Me
Or Maybe Its Karma
They Say Is A Charmer
Halfway To A Night So I Stay In A Armor
I'm Fire On The Move
A Tire Looking Smooth
I'm Not Perfect But I Got A Desire To Improve
I'm Special
Like Kids In A Graduating Class
Having More Trouble Than Others When Addin Basic Math
Need You To Be Special Like Areba To Cootmore
Double O, Top Secret Agents With Suits On
Something So Deep It Da Drown Me
Friends Are Some Cool Dudes
I Vouch For The People Around Me
On Your End Its Simple

[Hook:]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1:]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of rappers in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, I'mma let those stay
So these nosy niggas won't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying on guessing
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit
Both of the deals, nothing under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners
Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, [?] and I write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash
And purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is something that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[Hook]

[TALKING:]
Southern Smoke {echo}
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank [?]
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke

[Verse 1:]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[Chorus:]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee

And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, 4 g's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]

[NICKELUS F:]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many [?]
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh
[?]

[CHORUS:]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[DRAKE:]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane [?]
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
[?] Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
[?] Pass the torch and sell they soul [?]
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they [?] to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and [?] dro and twenty stacks
[?]
[?]
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

[CHORUS:]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[VERSE 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular ? they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim

[CHORUS]
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna 
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[VERSE 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

[CHORUS]
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes

Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down

Don't Put It Past Them

Lately I Dont Know About The Friends That I Hang With
Im Nervous Round My Boys, It Depends On Their Anguish
Depends On If They Saving All The Tops On Pepsi
With Dreams Of Seeing Girls Topless On Jet Skis
Depends On What They Do To Achieve That
Robbing R&B Singers, 'specially If They Know Where The Keys At
'specially If They Know Where They Girl Live
Get The Info, Leave With Ya Money Man, Thats How The World Is

Thats How Niggas Puttin They Dirt Down
Streets Are Seedy I Call Em Sesame... Berkstown
'specially When These Young'ns Get Turned Down For Work Opportunities
Next Week Same Place'll Get Burnt Down
Coincidink? Not Likely Not A Chance
How Can We Be So Aware Of These Problems And Not Advance?
At Least Start Put A Bid In, Its Hard Just To Fit In
A Lot Of People Only Play They Part When They Spittin
But I Dont Think That They Understood
They Using This Darkness For Penetration In The Hood
I Took The Ivory Way In And Yes Im Glad That Keenan Could
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good

Look,
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin
Because They Swimmin In Women
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors
They Come In Secret Flavors
Thats Why I Envy Omar
Because So Far

And Thats Some Higher Learning
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot
With The Tires Burnin
And Im A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith
In Any Female Thats Askin What I Was Earnin
I Met This Recent Lady
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy
Now Im Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately
Im All Alone, I Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh

Loves Lost
Loves Gone
Love Lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces
Circling Workplaces
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is
They Get To First Bases
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin
He Wanna Know What The First Trace Is
Now You Like Macgyver
Cuz You Sneakin Around
And She Dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her
I Cant Relate To That
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact

I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It
With [?] And They Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In
And In The End I Listen But I Dont See Me As They Do
Cuz Its My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls
Either Way Im All Alone, Got A Feelin Its On
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh

Check,
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet
But Theres Logic Behind It
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It
I Tend To Freak With This
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss
Thinkin She Been Spoiled
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days
And Come Up With Tin Foil

We Could Dissect It See
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing
Gave Her Nothing
Her Reputations In Jeopardy
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling Im Wrong
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh

If You A Girl With The Aspirations
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin
I Ask You To Have Some Patience
(You're Worth So Much More)
To My Dudes In The Bar With A Freak And
Steady Lightin Cigars In The Parties They Sneak In
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz
@@@@@@@@@@


[Drake: Talking]
Uh, Yea, Get In My Slick Rick Mode
N'a Mean?, Im A Tell Ya A Story Real Quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look,
She Got A Saying Theres No Alice Without The Tin Man
Crib Was 2 Mil, Plus I Just Bought A Couch For Ten Grand
Even If The House Was Ten Grand
And There Was No Pool
Would I Still Be Witout My Swim Fan?
The Ceiling Could Be Higher
She Making Requests
Dont Know If She Feeling Me Or She Be Feelin What I Buy Her
And Purses Are Light Now
She Use Em All The Time
So She Smilin To The The Point That It Hurt When She Bite Down
And She Simply A New Model
Stay Spendin Dollars
But She Got Less Sense Than A Empty Perfume Bottle
At Times She A Solid Chick
And Im A Sucka For The Cuties
So She Always Lookin Good When My Wallets Thick
Chillin On The Linen, She All Up In The Closet So Much
Got A Hunch Thats Shes Feelin Other Women
Want The Diamonds On The Face In The Center
Nice Guys Finish Last So Im Winnin Every Race That I Enter And She A

[Chorus:]
Video Girl
Eh Yo You Have To Listen
Im In A Bad Position
I Fell In Love With A
Video Girl
I Wouldnt Call Her Name
I Got The Feelin That They All The Same

And She A
Video Girl
To The Fullest Extent
So I Wrote You A Song
Cuz I Cant Stay With A
Video Girl
And You Betrayed Your Wealth
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
You're All The Same
Look At Vida Guerrera
Theres No Need To Compare Her
I Bet She Smiles Cuz She Loves What She Sees In The Mirror
I Bet Shes Out Meetin Directors Instead
And Frustratrated Cuz Shes Already Been Addressed In They Head
Be A Teacher, Open Up Shop If You Can Do Nails Fine
Apply For A Business Loan And I'll Bet You That They'll Sign
If You A Real Dime
Poppin As If Its Your Only Option
Girl Theres Things To Do
Other Than Jail Time
Look This Aint A Song Dissing Half Of These Rappers
Or Pasha And Sasha, Esther Baxter
Melyssa Ford, Or Katy Or Anyone After
I Just Give My Opinion For Laughter
Or Maybe To Think On
So Next Time You Out At The Club
And A Brother Offers The Whole Table Something To Drink On
You Just Take In Effect He Got A Stack With A Mink On
Now He Got You Doing Everything That You Think Wrong
Look, You Tell Your Parents That Its Cash At An Easy Pace
Ya Dad Screaming Take Ya Ass Outta Jeezy Face
And As Ya Man I Wont Back Down First
But They Got You Doing Soft-Core Background Work
That Messed Up Like An Officer That Pulls You Over
And He Ask Questions Later And Pat Down First
But You Aint Thandie Newton, And This Aint Crash Here
The Resolutions Passed Baby, This Aint Last Year
Look, I Got A Message, I'll Say It
I Got Some Beats Still
Regina Hall And Garcelle And Alice Neal
Young Girls These Here Women With Big Dreams
Role Models That You Can Watch On The Big Screen
If You Refuse To Change And You That Chick Still
Respect Yourself, Dont Be Convinced That These Tricks Will
You Got An Audience Believe It Or Not
My Cousin Who Cant Speak Know The Lyrics To Tip Drill

[Chorus:]
Video Girl
Eh Yo You Have To Listen
Im In A Bad Position
I Fell In Love With A
Video Girl
I Wouldnt Call Her Name
I Got The Feelin That They All The Same
And She A
Video Girl
To The Fullest Extent
So I Wrote You A Song
Cuz I Cant Stay With A
Video Girl
And You Betrayed Your Wealth
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself

[Drake: Speaking]
And I Aint Trying Ta Generalize Every Video Girl, You N'a Mean?
Say That Ya All One Way Man Its Just That Sometimes Man You Gotta
Accept The Fact That Theres Times That You Gotta Better Yourself
You Know As A Person Man. I Love To See My Black Women Strong, Single,
Independent. Doing They Thing Without Popping They Booty In Some Rappers
Video You N'a Mean? Its A Wonderful Thing Baby. So Uh, Dont Hate Me For
This One Ladies. Just Take My Advice You N'a Mean? Cuz Its Like Uh,
If She Beautiful And Honey Dances
And You Always Downtown Making Money Transfers
And Anything The Color Of Braces She Get Excited
She Always Showing Up At These Places She Get Invited
She A Video Girl
